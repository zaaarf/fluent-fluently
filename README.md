# Fluent, fluently
I found myself needing to do localisation, one time. I decided I'd want it to happen at runtime, so that any spelling fixes may be applied without needing to recompile the whole program. [Fluent](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent-rs) provides an API, but no real way to use it. I couldn't find any existing implementation fitting my use case, so I wrote this.
